# WordyBuddy
An IoT device that gives you meaning of the word you want. Adding to this feature, it also gives 5 words daily for the person to learn with its meaning and Part of Speech.
I have used Wordnik API for getting word meaning, Part of Speech and the daily 5 words itself fromthe given API. 
Pin Connection are as follows:
Oled      NodeMcu

Vcc       3v/5v
Gnd       Gnd
SCL       D1
SDA       D2

Switch      NodeMcu 
One end     D4
Other end   3v/5v

The header files that are included are all availble over internet and most of them come with the NodeMcu board managers librabries. Only ArduinoJson librabry is externally included. It can be found over internet very easily.
All the best!
